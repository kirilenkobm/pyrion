[ ] GenomicInterval -> Transcript (like bed-6 -> bed-12 for compatibility with TOGA)

[ ] SequencesAlignment class - wrapper for SequencesCollection

[ ] visualization for sequences

[ ] revise metadata (what is helpful to add? Some API to work with metadata)

[ ] verbosity and logging

[ ] AlignerStrategy: SequencesCollection, AlignerName -> SequencesAlignment

- list available aligners (like is mafft installed?)
- for each - manage settings io/subprocess/parsing output
- extension point for users
- maybe built-in basic NW pairwise aligner

[ ] revise tests and coverage - tests for some close-to-practice scenarios

- fasta+fai does not seem to be tested at all
- gtf parsing - need at least a small sample

[ ] support gz-ed inputs

[ ] Maf reader + respective Genome-Alignment-precursor structure (?)

[ ] Better visuals

[ ] gff3 reading (?)


[ ] If need be - CLI wrapper for some very common operations

[ ] Transcripts tokenizer

[ ] Isoform graphs

[ ] For my pet-project - matrix of all possible bindings in an RNA sequence

[ ] low prio: some vcf support

[ ] low prio: networks wrapper for trees

[ ] add ambiguous nucleotide codes
