[x] CodonSequence:

len - # codons, not # nucleotides
slice and inteding - for codons too

[x] SequencesCollectionClass with "is_aligned" field.

[ ] AlignerStrategy: SequencesCollection, AlignerName -> SequencesCollection.is_aligned

- list available aligners (like is mafft installed?)
- for each - manage settings io/subprocess/parsing output
- extension point for users
- maybe built-in basic NW pairwise aligner

[ ] revise metadata (what is helpful to add? Some API to work with metadata)

[ ] verbosity and logging

[x] tests for fasta+fai

[x] gtf parsing - need at least a small sample

[ ] better gtf parsing test - compare with actual kent tools output

[x] support gz-ed inputs

[ ] support gz-ed inputs, but this time good

[ ] Maf reader + respective Genome-Alignment-precursor structure (?)

[ ] Better visuals

[ ] visualization for sequences - showali-style interactive?

[ ] gff3 reading (?)

[ ] If need be - CLI wrapper for some very common operations

[ ] Transcripts tokenizer

[ ] Isoform graphs

[ ] low prio: some vcf support

[ ] low prio: networks wrapper for trees

[ ] add ambiguous nucleotide codes

[ ] parallelization/exec module (extendable, strategy pattern, slurm/nextflow/etc)

[ ] for v1.0.0 - check that the codebase follows the "avoid unnecessary computations" principle.

For instance, attaching data for TranscriptsCollection is an operation that changes Transcripts.
